# Sorting Algorithms :computer::rocket:

4 different sorting algorithms implemented in C :robot: and Python :snake:. 3 different scripts to compile, run and time all of them, run.sh(Runs both C and Python implementations), crun.sh (Runs C implementation) pyrun.sh (Runs Python implementation).

 - The programs generate an array of random numbers (100,000 for C and 10,000 for Python).
 - run.sh and crun.sh assume GCC is installed, changing gcc to clang works.:wrench:
 - Plotting in Python is disabled by default.
